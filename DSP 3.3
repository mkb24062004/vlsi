Write a program to check the stability of the system having the transfer function H(z)=(z-0.8)/(z2-1.2z+0.72). Determine the stability and plot the pole-zero diagram. Also, add a message indicating whether the system is stable or unstable.
Note: A discrete-time system is stable if all poles are inside the unit circle (∣z∣<1).

clc; clear; clf;
N = poly([-0.8 1], "z", "coeff");
D = poly([0.72 -1.2 1], "z", "coeff");
s = syslin('d',N,D)
plzr(s)

poles = roots(D);
if (abs(poles) < 1) then
    disp("The system is STABLE (all poles are inside the unit circle).");
else
    disp("The system is UNSTABLE (one or more poles are outside the unit circle).");
end
