A digital filter is designed with the transfer function:
H(z)=(1+0.5z−1)/(1−0.9z−1+0.81z−2)
Compute the poles and zeros of the filter. Plot the pole-zero diagram, discuss the relationship between pole-zero locations and filter characteristics. 
Discuss whether the filter is stable and what kind of response (low-pass, high-pass, etc.) it exhibits based on the pole-zero plot.
