1.	Write a program to compute the poles and zeros of a transfer function given its numerator and denominator coefficients. 
Use N(z)=z2-0.5z+0.25 and D(z)=z2+0.4z+0.2. Plot the poles and zeros on the complex plane, marking zeros with a circle (o) 
and poles with a cross (x). Label the axes and include the unit circle for reference.
2.	Modify the above program to allow the user to input the numerator and denominator coefficients interactively.
 Compute and display the poles and zeros. Plot the pole-zero diagram for the user-defined transfer function.
